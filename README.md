 Preboot eXecution Environment, PXE- specification describes a standardized clientâ€“server environment that boots a software assembly, retrieved from a network, 
 on PXE-enabled clients. On the client side it requires only a PXE-capable network interface controller (NIC), 
 and uses a small set of industry-standard network protocols such as DHCP and TFTP.
